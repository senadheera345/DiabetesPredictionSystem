# Diabetes Prediction System
#### Demo Link: https://diabetespredictionsystem-sliit-fdmproject.streamlit.app/

## Background
This project aims to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information. Diabetes is a chronic condition affecting millions worldwide, and early detection is crucial for better patient outcomes. By analyzing medical and demographic factors such as age, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels, we developed a machine learning model to assist in early diabetes detection and management.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Early Diabetes Detection**: Predict the likelihood of diabetes to help healthcare professionals identify high-risk patients and implement preventive measures.
2. **Personalized Treatment**: Support healthcare providers in creating personalized treatment plans based on risk profiles.
3. **Research Insights**: Facilitate research into the relationships between risk factors and diabetes development, providing valuable insights for prevention and treatment.
4. **Patient Empowerment**: Enable patients to understand their risk factors, make lifestyle changes, and seek timely medical advice.

## Scope of Work
The main goal is to provide a reliable solution for predicting diabetes using machine learning. We used regression models to analyze the dataset and identify the most accurate algorithm. The optimal model was deployed as a user-friendly web application, allowing users to input their details and receive predictions.

As a deliverable, the project includes:
- A high-performing machine learning model.
- A web application for real-time diabetes prediction.
- A final project report summarizing results.

## Methodology
The project followed these steps:
1. **Dataset Selection**: A suitable dataset was sourced online and supervised by the project mentor.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns and relationships in the dataset.
4. **Model Building**: Evaluated four machine learning models to find the most accurate:
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Logistic Regression
